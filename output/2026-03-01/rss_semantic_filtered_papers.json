In this work, a molecular polarity‐weakening strategy of electrolyte additive is proposed to customize a rapid‐reaction‐kinetics solvation structure and a hybrid solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) for Zn metal pouch batteries. Leveraging this synergistic solvation‐SEI regulation, a 25 cm2 Zn||Zn pouch symmetric cell achieves unprecedent 352 h stable cycling at 40 mAh cm−2 (DOD = 68%, 10 mA cm−2). More importantly, a 100 cm2 Zn||I2 pouch full battery delivers a high areal capacity of 9.8 mAh cm−2 and sustains nearly 400 h of stable cycling.",

    "abstract": "A gradient cyano‐functionalized separator is designed to regulate polyiodide distribution and zinc‐ion flux in static Zn//I2 batteries. The cathode‐facing dense layer confines polyiodides and activates latent host reaction sites via a reversed concentration gradient, while the anode‐facing thin layer stabilizes Zn deposition. This synergy enables ultrahigh iodine utilization and record areal capacity under high I/C ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe development of static aqueous zinc‐iodine batteries (SAZIBs) is hindered by the polyiodide shuttling effect and poor zinc anode reversibility, issues that are exacerbated under high iodine loadings essential for high energy density. Herein, a gradient‐structured separator (G‐CCN@GF) is designed by modifying a glass fiber separator with 2D cyano‐functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (CCN). Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the dense CCN layer facing the cathode effectively anchors polyiodides and unlocks latent electrochemical active sites, thereby facilitating conversion kinetics under high iodine loading and I/C ratio. Meanwhile, the thin and uniform CCN layer on the anode side promotes a uniform Zn2+ flux, significantly improving the zinc reversibility under high depth of discharge (DOD). Consequently, the Zn/G‐CCN@GF/I2 battery with a conventional activated carbon (AC) host achieves exceptional performance under high I/C ratio (2:1) conditions, including a high areal capacity of 27.9 mAh cm−2 at 150.1 mg cm−2 iodine loading and remarkable stability over 7200 cycles at 40 mg cm−2. A 60 cm2 pouch cell further validates practicality, delivering 5.8 mAh cm−2 and retaining 85.87% capacity after 1100 cycles. This work provides a feasible separator‐engineering strategy for high‐energy‐density SAZIBs.",

We decipher the operational protocols, analyze the multi‐step complexity of stripping, contrast its mechanistic disparities with plating, and assess the limitations of deposition‐centric strategies. We evaluate current stripping‐oriented approaches and argue the significance of chemo‐mechano‐thermal regulation during zinc stripping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe quest for stable aqueous zinc metal batteries has rightly focused on taming the unruly nature of zinc deposition. Pioneering research has produced a wealth of strategies to achieve uniform zinc plating. While these methods have significantly improved performance in laboratory half‐cells, a stubborn performance gap persists when moving to practical full‐cells. This chasm points to a fundamental oversight: the critical impact of the anode's initial stripping in a full‐cell configuration with zinc‐free cathodes. In this perspective, we highlight the pivotal yet underappreciated role of the initial zinc stripping process. We first decipher the operational protocols of zinc‐free cathode systems to illustrate how the initial stripping dynamically reshapes the anode and interface. By analyzing the multi‐step complexity of stripping, we contrast its mechanistic disparities with plating and assess the limitations of deposition‐centric strategies. We then evaluate current approaches that enhance full‐cell performance through optimized dissolution. Finally, looking toward future multi‐scenario applications, we argue that research must address the intricate coupling among stripping dynamics, chemo‐mechano‐thermal responses, and the crystallographic properties of zinc anodes. This paradigm shift from a plating‐centric view to a full‐cycle‐oriented is paramount to unlocking the full potential of the zinc metal anode for grid‐scale energy storage and beyond.",

Here we elucidate lean‐failure mechanisms and develop a COF@PAN functional separator that regulates hydrogen‐bonding networks to manage water activity and accelerate infiltration, enabling high‐energy, durable Zn pouch cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nDespite zinc metal batteries offering attractions such as natural abundance, safety, and sustainability, their widespread adoption is hindered by a critical, underexplored limitation: intrinsically low device‐level energy density. While previous research has prioritized stabilizing zinc anodes to suppress dendrites, practical energy densities remain constrained by excessive inactive components (separators, electrolytes) that dominate device mass and volume. Conventional strategies, such as cell upscaling, exacerbate this issue by necessitating surplus electrolyte, leading to inflated electrolyte to capacity ratios (> 10 g Ah−1) and poor specific/volumetric energy metrics (e.g., ∼5 Wh kg−1). Current reporting practices, focusing on Ah or idealized active‐material metrics, further obscure true performance, masking the urgent need for holistic design innovations. Crucially, lean‐electrolyte operation, essential for high energy density, introduces unaddressed challenges like interfacial water depletion and activity mismanagement. This work bridges this gap by systematically unraveling failure mechanisms under lean conditions and pioneering a functional separator that optimizes water management and ion transport. By redefining hydrogen‐bonding networks to mitigate water consumption and enable rapid infiltration, the developed COF@PAN separator achieves unprecedented energy densities (54.0 Wh kg−1, 185.3 Wh L−1) and cycle stability (over 800 cycles) in practical pouch cells. These insights and designs advance Zn metal batteries beyond lab‐scale promises, positioning them as viable contenders for energy‐dense, real‐world applications.",

Benefitting from the improved interfacial contact and enhanced toughness by heating treatment, this biogel electrolyte facilitates a Zn2+ 3D diffusion and suppresses dendrite Zn growth to regulate Zn anode interfacial compatibility, thereby achieving leading performance in hybrid capacitors and excellent outdoor applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGel electrolytes are high‐priority materials for solid‐state Zn‐ion hybrid capacitors, characterized by high ionic conductivity and intrinsic mechanical flexibility. However, because the existing gel electrolytes are relatively soft and do not contact intimately with rigid Zn anodes, they have inferior interfacial compatibility with Zn anodes, leading to device degradation. Here we develop a class of biogel electrolytes by in situ crystallizing gelatin triple helix units from the alginate polymer domain to form a unique hierarchical‐heterogeneous structure. The biogel electrolyte demonstrates combined advantages of high toughness, temperature‐triggered adhesion, high Zn2+ transference number and temperature‐independent ionic conductivity. These notable features favor Zn2+ 3D diffusion and accommodate zinc anode volume changes, thus enabling the symmetric Zn||Zn cell to highlight a balance among high current density, high areal capacity and prolonged cycling life. Moreover, the assembled zinc||activated carbon hybrid capacitor performs exceptional capacitive behavior and stable operation across the temperature range from 25°C to –40°C, delivering competitive energy density of 125.5 Wh kg−1 with high capacity retention of 97.1% over 10 000 cycles even at −40°C. Finally, system‐level demonstration based on the resulting hybrid capacitors can power portable electronics in a power cable‐free manner, validating applicability for green power sources in outdoor activities.",

    "abstract": "A synergistic network featuring strong Zn2+ coordination anchors and flexible hydrogen‐bond bridges is designed to reconcile the intrinsic trade‐off between anti‐freezing and self‐healing properties in zinc‐ion batteries, while robust in situ interfacial polymerization ensures intimate electrode contact. The electrolyte remains unfrozen at −75°C, self‐heals within 10 min at −20°C, and suppresses parasitic reactions via Zn2+ solvation sheath reconstruction. Batteries exhibit 97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 over an 80°C temperature range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe commercialization of aqueous zinc‐ion batteries is hampered by a fundamental paradox: electrolytes with anti‐freezing properties typically lack self‐healing capability, and vice versa. Herein, we decouple this trade‐off through the ingenious design of a synergistic network within a eutectogel electrolyte. This network is governed by strong Zn2+ coordination acting as rigid anchors, coupled with a dynamic quaternary hydrogen‐bond (HB) network involving glycerol, ClO4−, water, and polyacrylamide serving as flexible bridges. In this configuration, the strong Zn2+ coordination and dense hydrogen bonds synergistically inhibit ice lattice formation to ensure anti‐freezing, while the reversible hydrogen bonds enable dynamic molecular reconfiguration for self‐healing. The resulting gel remains ice‐free at −75°C and self‐heals within 10 min even at −20°C. Concurrently, this unique structure reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation sheath, significantly reducing the water coordination number from 3.65 to 2.62, which effectively suppresses water‐induced parasitic reactions. Coupled with robust in situ interfacial engineering, the assembled battery exhibits a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability (97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1) over a wide temperature range of 80°C (−20°C–60°C). This work not only provides a high‐performance electrolyte for practical zinc batteries but also establishes an innovative design paradigm for resolving property conflicts in advanced functional materials.",

Therefore, we propose a Zn2+ highway regulator strategy by introducing nano‐zirconium silicate interphase (ZSP) to address the above issues. ZSP with low Zn2+ migration energy barrier of ZrSiO4 can facilitate Zn2+ transport efficiency and inhibit dendrite growth, thereby achieving highly reversible zinc metal anode.

Even under a deep depth of discharge ≈85.4%, it still maintains stable operation for over 400 h. Furthermore, the advanced NH4V4O10//ZSP@Zn full cell, featuring a high mass loading of 15.25 mg cm−2 (N/P = 2.1), exhibited stable performance over 520 cycles (1 A g−1), retaining 80.48% of initial capacity (187.32 mAh g−1).

    "abstract": "Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries suffer from rapid decay under practical conditions due to bilateral Zn2+/Mn2+ ionic crosstalk, a system‐level failure mechanism. We develop a hierarchical fluorinated polymer separator that regulates ion fluxes and stabilizes both electrodes simultaneously. This strategy enables extended cycle life while maintaining capacity, establishing ion flux regulation as a key design principle for durable zinc‐based energy storage systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous Zn//MnO2 batteries hold significant promise for safe and cost‐effective large‐scale energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by rapid performance degradation. Here, we identify bilateral ionic crosstalk, a previously overlooked failure mechanism driven by active ion, as a root cause of electrode degradation. We demonstrate that excess Zn2+ migrating from the anode induces irreversible phase transitions at the MnO2 cathode, forming electrochemically inert Znx(MnO2)y phase (ZMO sclerosis). Concurrently, dissolved Mn2+ from the cathode exacerbates corrosion and dendrite growth on the Zn anode. To mitigate this crosstalk, we design a hierarchical fluorinated polymer separator (HFPS). Such HFPS enables selective cation coordination and guides ion transport, achieving simultaneous regulation of Zn2+ and Mn2+ fluxes. This targeted regulation effectively mitigates ionic crosstalk and stabilizes both electrodes. Batteries employing the HFPS exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining 97% capacity after 1,000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 with stable operation exceeding 500 h. This performance represents a 54% lifespan enhancement over state‐of‐the‐art aqueous counterparts. Our work provides a fundamental mechanistic understanding of active‐ion‐induced failure and establishes ion flux regulation as a universal design strategy for durable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.",

This work introduces a novel hygroscopic vanadium metal–organic framework (V‐MOF) as a multifunctional protective layer to achieve an outstanding Zn anode. The as‐fabricated battery can remain stable and high performance with high DOD of 85.5% and fast discharging rate of 50 mAh/cm2. The hygroscopic V‐MOF nature removes solvated shells and captures water as bonded/iced water within its structure, significantly suppressing side reactions. In addition, the V‐MOF coating optimized the electrical field, inhibited the cracks, and reduced the Zn dendrite formation even at a high rate of 50 mAh/cm2, due to the construction of electrolyte‐philic and smooth surface. Consequently, the hygroscopic Zn/V‐MOF symmetrical cells achieve exceptional performance over 1000 h under 50 mA/cm2 (50 mAh/cm2) with 85.5% DOD. The Zn/V‐MOF||V2O3/NC cell shows a capacity of 267 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g with excellent rate capability (100 mAh/g @20 A/g). In addition, it achieves an outstanding lifetime over 3300 cycles @ 5 A/g.

Precise tuning of water activity enables fast ion transport and stabilization of four‐electron redox pathways, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions and delivering high‐capacity, durable aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWater governs both reactivity and transport in aqueous batteries, yet the occurrence of distinct free, coordinated, and network‐bound states complicates electrolyte design. Here, a quantitative water‐speciation identification (QWSI) strategy is established to resolve and quantify water populations and to correlate composition with microstructure and function. Aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries are employed as a model system owing to the high sensitivity of capacity to water‐state distributions. Eliminating free water stabilizes electrophilic iodine species and activates the I2/2I+ couple to realize a four‐electron conversion that doubles capacity, whereas driving water content too low depletes coordinated and network‐bound water, slows ion transport, and ultimately compromises capacity. The QWSI strategy pinpoints a critical composition at which water resides within hydrogen‐bond networks and cation solvation shells, with no detectable bulk‐like free water. Electrolytes formulated at this composition sustain four‐electron conversion while maintaining high ionic conductivity, reconciling activation of four‐electron conversion with ion transport. Consequently, the Zn//I2 cells deliver distinct two‐plateau profiles and high reversibility, enabling an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and a specific capacity of 309.1 mAh·g−1. These findings define molecular control of water‐state distributions as a design principle, while the QWSI strategy provides quantitative descriptors for predictive control of solvation and reactivity across aqueous electrochemistry.",

    "abstract": "A nitrogen‐rich interphase is in situ constructed on the surface of the zinc anode. It not only exerts an electrostatic shielding effect to guide uniform electric fields during zinc deposition, but also induces Zn2⁺ to preferentially deposit on the low‐surface‐energy plane, thus boosting Zn (002) plane texture with high depth of discharge (DOD) for long‐term zinc metal batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nDue to uncontrollable interfacial reactions in aqueous electrolytes, zinc metal anodes typically suffer from severe dendrite growth and side reactions, significantly hindering the practical application of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Herein, a nitrogen‐rich interphase is in situ constructed on the surface of the zinc anode by incorporating tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) into the electrolyte. The nitrogen‐rich interphase regulates interfacial charge via electrostatic shielding effect, enabling Zn2⁺ to be guided by uniform electric fields during deposition. Meanwhile, the nitrogen‐rich groups coordinate with or electrostatically adsorb Zn2+, driving preferential deposition on the low‐surface‐energy (002) plane rather than high‐energy crystal planes (e.g., (100), (101)) and thereby suppressing the occurrence of disordered dendrites and side reactions. As a result, the Zn symmetric batteries with the nitrogen‐rich interphase exhibit excellent stability for over 340 h under a depth of discharge of 65.3%, and still achieve stable cycling for over 450 h at an ultrahigh current density of 63.0 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn||NH4V4O10 full batteries can retain 91.2% of initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Such a finding provides valuable guidance for rationally designing interphases to address interfacial issues in long‐life zinc metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to advance beyond the traditional problem‐strategy framework by introducing an integrative concept for the construction of kinetic repair zones at the interface. Stabilizing Zn anodes requires controlling the interfacial chemical environment to guide deposition kinetics, not altering zinc's thermodynamics. This review systematizes the mechanisms into ion flux, interface chemistry, and nucleation/growth, offering a coherent framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc‐ion batteries are promising for large‐scale energy storage due to their safety and cost‐effectiveness. The industrial application of zinc metal anodes is impeded by challenges, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and interfacial passivation. Current research, though abundant in strategies, lacks a unified scientific framework, leading to fragmented progress. This review examines strategies for managing the chemical environment at the interface. The failure of zinc anodes is due to thermodynamic instability, which is evident through side reactions, and kinetic heterogeneity, as demonstrated by the random growth of dendrites. This article provides a systematic review of the fundamental mechanisms of strategies across three principal dimensions: ion flux regulation, interfacial chemistry modulation, and nucleation/growth control. Examples include ion flow regulation for uniform Zn2+ transport and electric field uniformity, interface chemistry regulation to minimize water activity and side reactions, artificial solid electrolyte interphase construction, solvation structure reconstruction, and regulation of nucleation and growth for dense deposition through heterogeneous nucleation and interfacial energy optimization. This review highlights antagonistic effects in multi‐strategy synergy and critiques the materials‐first trap, along with the misleading nature of unrealistic experimental conditions. Finally, it offers an overview of essential avenues for practical application.",

    "abstract": "The disordered growth of dendrites, corrosion, parasitic side reactions, slow de‐solvation kinetics, and inherent safety risks significantly hinder the practical deployment of conventional liquid electrolyte zinc‐ion batteries. In contrast, the novel PU‐EG+DMPA‐Zn polyurethane quasi‐solid‐state electrolyte, enriched with abundant polar functional groups, facilitates rapid de‐solvation and Zn2⁺ migration via hydrogen bond reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nQuasi‐solid electrolytes (QSEs) have emerged as a highly promising solution to address key challenges in zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs). However, QSEs often rely on a significant amount of water (H2O) to facilitate rapid Zn2+ migration, which can lead to undesirable side reactions at the Zn anode. Here, polyurethane supramolecular multiblock copolymers (PU‐EG+DMPA‐Zn) are synthesized from the perspective of polymer block structure design. Interactions between zinc salts and carboxyl groups in the chain extender enhance zinc salt solubility while disrupting the intrinsic hydrogen bond network within the polymer matrix. This modification extends the hydrogen bonds between the polymer and H2O, regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and suppresses side reactions at the anode interface. Additionally, the in situ forms gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling provides a robust protective barrier that significantly enhances the reversibility of zinc anodes. The abundant hydrogen bond network endows the PU‐EG+DMPA‐Zn QSE with anti‐freezing properties, allowing the symmetric battery to maintain a stable plating/stripping process for 3000 h at −20 °C. The assembled Zn‐MnO2 battery demonstrates a capacity retention rate of 93.8% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Overall, this work provides a unique design strategy for developing high‐performance quasi‐solid electrolytes.",

The resulting CC3‐ASEI with unique 3D interpenetrated electronegative channels and superior zincophilicity bestows rapid desolvation, fast Zn2+ migration, uniform Zn2+ flux, and oriented Zn deposition, which overcomes the long‐standing challenges of dendritic growth and parasitic reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), as a newly emerging candidate for large‐scale energy storage, suffer from severe dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution, and Zn‐metal corrosion, posing a huge challenge for commercial application. Herein, a representative porous organic cage (POC), namely CC3, is proposed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) through a facile electrospray technique. Owing to the characteristic internal cavities, 3D interpenetrated channels, partial disorder enhanced porosity, zincophilicity, and solution processability, the CC3‐ASEI is not only conducive to enable rapid desolvation and migration of Zn2+ through ASEI, but also affords uniform Zn2+ flux and oriented Zn deposition, thus effectively suppressing dendrite growth and parasitic reactions. As a result, the CC3‐ASEI bestows an outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.86% for 5000 cycles in the Zn||Ti asymmetric cell and remarkably stable Zn plating/stripping over 7100 h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell. Besides, the implementation of this CC3‐ASEI also markedly improves the rate capability and cycling stability of AZBs with various cathodes, highlighting the great potential of employing POCs to promote the practical application of AZBs.",

    "abstract": "In this work, 3‐(amidinothio)‐1‐propanesulfonic acid are deployed as an additive to mimic the directional cargo delivery of kinesins. Specifically, the iso‐thiourea groups of the additive adsorb and anchor onto Zn(002) planes, while sulfonic acid groups are responsible for capturing Zn2+ ions to facilitate their deposition. The adaptive “anchor‐capture” mechanism results in a highly textured and reversible Zn anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe practical implementation of zinc (Zn) metal electrode in rechargeable aqueous batteries remains hindered by uncontrolled dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions, primarily stemming from unregulated ion transport and high water activity. Inspired by directional cargo‐transport function of kinesins, here a mimetic ion director, represented by 3‐(amidinothio)‐1‐propanesulfonic acid (APSA), is deployed to regulate Zn deposition and suppress side reactions. When added into the electrolyte, the iso‐thiourea groups of APSA selectively anchor to Zn(002) facets, mimicking microtubule‐binding domain of kinesin, while the sulfonic acid groups locally concentrate Zn2+ ions near the anchored sites, resembling cargo‐binding domains. This bio‐inspired “anchor‐capture” synergy enables dynamic, self‐adaptive regulation of Zn2+ ion flux, thereby guiding oriented Zn deposition and suppressing dendrite formation. Meanwhile, APSA reduces both interfacial and bulk water activity, thus mitigating side reactions. As a result, the novel bio‐inspired electrolyte dramatically extends the cycle life of aqueous Zn batteries. Remarkably, a Zn//NaV3O8·1.5H2O full battery comprising of an ultrathin Zn anode (20 µm) and a low N/P ratio (≈6) retains 93.40% of capacity after 400 cycles (over 600 h). This work provides a novel biomimetic ion transport regulation strategy that enables directional metal deposition, offering a transformative pathway toward highly stable and reversible metal batteries.",

Additives featuring low polarizability and surface energy matched to ZnSO4 induce a compact, water‐deficient electrical double layer, facilitating uniform Zn deposition and suppressing side reactions. Oxamide is identified as an optimal additive, enabling dendrite‐free and stable Zn cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOrganic electrolyte additives have emerged as a promising strategy to regulate interfacial reactions at the Zn anode in aqueous batteries, yet their design remains largely empirical owing to a lack of molecular‐level understanding. In this work, a dual‐descriptor framework based on molecular polarizability and surface energy to guide the rational screening of electrolyte additives for stable Zn deposition is introduced. Systematic evaluation reveals that lower polarizability promotes the formation of a compact, water‐deficient electrical double layer (EDL), which enhances Zn2+ desolvation and promotes rapid nucleation with oriented growth. Meanwhile, a moderately high surface energy, particularly when closely matched with that of the ZnSO4 electrolyte, ensures stable interfacial adsorption and synergizes with low polarizability to achieve uniform Zn deposition. In contrast, excessively high surface energy induces additive aggregation, weakens EDL compactness, and leads to uneven deposition and parasitic side reactions. Guided by this dual‐descriptor screening framework, oxamide is identified as a representative additive featuring low polarizability and well‐matched surface energy. Its incorporation improves Zn deposition morphology, enhances coulombic efficiency, and delivers superior cycling stability in both half‐cell and Zn‐MnO2 full‐cell configurations. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of descriptor‐guided additive design and offers a molecular‐level strategy for advancing stable and high‐performance aqueous Zn‐ion batteries.",

Restructuring the inner Helmholtz plane enhances interfacial stability, and Ion–dipole interactions suppress the shuttle effect of polyiodide species. This approach enables Zn‐I2 battery with excellent capacity and high rate capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous Zn‐I2 batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage, exhibit excellent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their practical application is limited by the two‐electron I−/I⁰ redox reaction and the severe shuttle effect of polyiodide species. Here, a multifunctional ionic liquid, 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bromide (BmimBr), is introduced to establish a dynamic interhalogen coupling between iodine and bromine species, which enables a six‐electron transfer pathway involving I−/I⁰/I⁺ and Br−/Br⁰. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations show that Br− acts as a dynamic mediator, forming an [IBr2]− intermediate with iodine. This significantly lowers the energy barrier for oxidizing I⁰ to I⁺, thereby contributing additional capacity and accelerating kinetics. Simultaneously, Bmim⁺ provides dual interfacial functions: confining polyiodides at the cathode to suppress shuttling, and forming a protective layer on the zinc anode, which reduces interfacial water, inhibits dendrite growth and side reactions. Leveraging this synergistic design, the Zn‐I2 battery achieves a high specific capacity of 511 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retains 90.22% of its capacity after 30 000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The dynamic interhalogen coupling strategy offers a novel route to activate multielectron reactions and stabilize electrode interfaces in Zn‐I2 batteries.",

    "abstract": "An adhesive tape–inspired anode stabilization strategy is proposed by grafting poly(methyl methacrylate) onto natural rubber. The resulting copolymer coating exhibits elasticity, adhesion, and ion‐selective nanodomains, which lower Zn2+ desolvation barriers, guide deposition to the stable (002) facet, and ensure intimate interfacial contact, delivering over 32,000 stable cycles in symmetric Zn cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe development of stable zinc anodes is critical for advancing high‐rate, long‐life aqueous zinc batteries. Here a tape‐inspired anode modification is reported using a poly (methyl methacrylate)‐grafted natural rubber (NRAc) copolymer as a conformal protective coating. The microphase‐separated architecture integrates elastic, hydrophobic NR domains with Zn2+‐coordinating PMMA nanodomains, forming mechanically adaptive and ion‐selective channels. Density functional theory and microscopy reveal that Zn2+ preferentially binds to PMMA, lowering desolvation barriers and biasing deposition toward the stable (002) facet. This dual mechanical‐chemical regulation suppresses dendrite growth and parasitic hydrogen evolution, while maintaining intimate interfacial contact under dynamic cycling. As a result, NRAc@Zn symmetric cells achieve unprecedented cycling lifetimes exceeding 32,000 cycles, while Zn||V2O5 full cells deliver stable operation at current densities up to 10 A g−1. Scaling to a 1.5 Ah pouch cell demonstrates the practical feasibility of the approach. This work establishes polymer microphase engineering, inspired by the multifunctionality of adhesive tapes, as a versatile strategy to stabilize Zn anodes and advance the deployment of aqueous Zn batteries for large‐scale energy storage.",

    "abstract": "A scalable organic–inorganic hybrid protective layer composed of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) and boron nitride nanosheets is introduced to stabilize Zn‐metal anodes. The hybrid architecture regulates Zn2+ transport, suppresses dendrite growth, and mitigates parasitic reactions, enabling uniform Zn deposition and long‐term stable cycling in aqueous Zn‐ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe practical application of aqueous Zn‐ion batteries (AZIBs) is severely limited by unstable Zn‐metal anodes caused by dendritic growth and parasitic interfacial reactions. Herein, we report an organic–inorganic hybrid protective layer composed of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS), fabricated via a scalable and controllable spray‐coating process. The hybrid architecture synergistically integrates the mechanical robustness of BNNS with the ion‐regulating functionality of SPEEK, effectively addressing the trade‐off between interfacial rigidity and ionic transport. This structure promotes uniform Zn2+ flux, suppresses dendrite growth, and stabilizes the Zn/electrolyte interface. Theoretical calculations, including density functional theory and nudged elastic band analysis, further reveal that SO3H groups in SPEEK lower the Zn2+ adsorption energy and migration barriers, facilitating Zn2+ transport across the protective layer. The hybrid protective layer enables long‐term stable Zn plating/stripping (>1800 h at 1 mA cm−2, 1 mAh cm−2) and uniform, dendrite‐free deposition, as directly visualized by in situ optical microscopy. Consistent interfacial stabilization is further confirmed in Zn/MnO2 full cells with improved rate capability and capacity retention. This work highlights a practical and rational interfacial design strategy for stabilizing Zn‐metal anodes toward durable AZIBs.",

    "abstract": "A multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte is designed for aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Benefitting from the synergistic effects of dimethyl sulfoxide and polyacrylamide chains, stable Zn plating/stripping and ultra‐low freezing point (−60 °C) are simultaneously achieved. By pairing with 3D infiltrated porous free‐standing α‐MnO2 cathode and Zn anode, a high‐performing, robust AZMB is further developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their low cost and high energy density. However, their practical applications are constrained by Zn dendritic growth, self‐corrosion, and poor low‐temperature adaptability. Herein, a multi‐component hydrogel electrolyte is proposed to address these challenges. Specifically, dimethyl sulfoxide is added to substitute H2O in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and disrupt the intrinsic H─bond network, suppressing interfacial parasitic reactions induced by active water and achieving ultra‐low freezing point (−60 °C); while the acylamino groups on polyacrylamide chains are utilized to coordinate with Zn2+ and SO42−, leading to homogeneous Zn2+ flux and reduced by‐products accumulation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, stable Zn plating/stripping with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% for 1200 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 is achieved. To manifest the superiority of the hydrogel electrolyte, free‐standing α‐MnO2/single‐walled carbon nanotube film is designed as cathode. The resulting AZMB exhibits large specific capacity, prominent rate capability (157.5 mAh g−1 at 10 C), high cyclic stability, and good low‐temperature performance (68.8% capacity retention at −20 °C), which also demonstrates excellent safety under extreme conditions of hammering, cutting, burning, punching, and soaking. This work provides an inspired strategy to build robust, multi‐functional, inexpensive aqueous batteries.",

    "abstract": "The latest advancements on high‐performance cryogenic aqueous zinc‐based batteries from a multifaceted perspective, including electrolyte engineering, cathode innovation, anode stabilization, and separator modification, to overcome challenges at low temperature, such as electrolyte freezing, sluggish ion kinetics, high interfacial resistance, aggregated dendritic growth, and electrode structural instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe burgeoning demand for energy storage in extreme cold environments has accelerated global research into low‐temperature battery technologies. Aqueous zinc‐based batteries (AZBs) emerge as a leading contender due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, their operation under cryogenic conditions is severely hindered by electrolyte freezing, sluggish ion kinetics, increased interfacial resistance, and rampant zinc dendrite growth. This review comprehensively summarizes cutting‐edge research breakthroughs from the past two years aimed at overcoming these barriers through a multifaceted strategy, covering electrolyte engineering, cathode innovation, anode stabilization, and separator modification. Key advances include the rational design of advanced electrolytes—such as liquid systems (e.g., ZnCl2‐based, Zn(ClO4)2‐based, ZnSO4‐based), along with novel suspension and gel polymer electrolytes—that disrupt hydrogen‐bond networks, optimize Zn2+ solvation/desolvation, and improve interfacial kinetics. We also highlight new inorganic and organic cathode materials with tailored structures, as well as highly active air cathodes that enhance low‐temperature reaction kinetics. Additionally, modified zinc anodes and functional separators with tailored ion‐transport channels are discussed. Finally, we provide a summary and forward‐looking perspectives on future research directions. This comprehensive survey can serve as a valuable dataset to inform machine learning approaches, ultimately guiding the accelerated development of practical low‐temperature AZBs.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic instability of the ZMA/electrolyte interface has been addressed by constructing a zincophilic hydroxypropyl cellulose hybrid layer (HZ@Zn) reinforced with hydrogen‐bonded networks on the zinc anode. This advantageous HZ@Zn not only improves ion transport kinetics but also shows lower desolvation activation energy during plating processes, resulting in an anode surface free from dendrites and by‐products even after ultra‐long cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAs an earth‐abundant and natural biopolymer, cellulose has received significant attention in aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs) due to its inherent sustainability and non‐toxicity, aligning perfectly with the core advantages of AZIBs. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of cellulose‐based materials is limited by their intrinsically low ionic conductivity. Herein, we introduce a novel zincophilic artificial protective layer by strategically hybridizing hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) with zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate on a zinc metal anode (HZ@Zn). Characterization and calculations demonstrate that the multi‐hydroxyl architecture of HPC constructs hydrogen bond networks, whereas the Zn2+‐coordinated HPC domains function as preferential nucleation sites for zinc deposition. These interactions collectively enhance ion transport and accelerate desolvation kinetics. Additionally, the hybrid layer's mechanical flexibility and interfacial adhesion ensure the integrity of the artificial protective layer during long cycling. Thanks to this synergistic effect, HZ@Zn shows exceptional electrochemical performance, including a low desolvation activation energy of 14.38 kJ mol−1 and ultra‐long cycling stability. Symmetric cells demonstrate exceptional longevity, exceeding 9,500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.25 mAh cm−2, whereas HZ@Zn‖PANI full cells maintain 89.8% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This study establishes biopolymers as versatile platforms for effectively stabilizing the zinc metal anode.",
